Arduino based obstacle avoidance robot

Daniel Atkinsons's Aberystwyth University final year major project
A small wheeled robot using both a Raspberry Pi and a number of Arduino microcontrollers to operate actuators and read sensors in order to move freely in an environment and avoid various obstacles it may come accross.

Current iteration has 2 sonar sensors mounted on the front and can avoid obstacles approaching from in front of the robot.

Current issues:
Need more sensors
Motors stutter a bit
