\section{Advantages and disadvantages}
There are several types of motors that can be used to drive wheels.  Each type will have various advantages and disadvantages over the other types.  This section will detail these and is aimed to come to a conclusion as to which type will be best for the application of Tria.

\subsection{DC motors}
DC motors as the name describes use direct current to drive them.  When power is supplied to one side and the other is connected to ground the motor is on.  When the curent is revesed by switching which side has power and which side is connected to ground the motor is also on, but turning in the opposite direction.  When neither side is supplied power it is off, and when both sides are supplied with power that is also off but potentialy damaging.
