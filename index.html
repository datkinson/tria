<p>This is the Git repository for Daniel Atkinson, a final yeal computer science undergraduate at Aberystwyth University</p>
<p>The following content will be related to his final year project hence the name "fyp"</p>

<h3>Basic Idea</h3>
<p>The base goal of this project is to design, build and program a small wheeled robot.<br />
This robot is to independantly move around freely within its environment and avoid the various obstacles it may face</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I tend to experiment with electronic components on a regular basis.  Due to this I try and make small working systems, originaly nothing more than a small timer or an audio amplifier.<br />
Naturaly the progression from pure electronics was to move onto microcontrollers given my computer science background.<br />
After making various projects using pic and arduino microcontrollers I decided to make an Arduino based robot.<br />
This robot was just a chassis kit (magician), which included the frame, two wheels, two motors and a battery holder.  From this all I had to add was an Arduino microcontroller and a sensor, for this I used a sharpe IR (infra-red) sensor, mounted inside the shassis pointing out of the front.<br />
The code for this early 'prototype' was very simplistic and was along these sorts of lines:
</p>
<pre>
<code>void loop(){
if(sensor_range < value)
	{
		motors.turn(random);
	}else
	{
		motors.forward(1);
	}
}</code>
</pre>
<!--

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
